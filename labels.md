Project labels
==============

Github issue queue labelling allows issues to be sorted based on a variety of facets. In the past we've developed several different types of label facet groups such as for issue category, status, priority and severity.

Use this list to set up new repo label lists:

**PRIORITY** (full strength)
Use these labels to indicate which issues are most critical to the success of the project and which are of lesser importance

* critical (red)
* major (orange)
* normal (warm yellow)
* minor (pale yellow)

**CATEGORY** (warm pastels)
These issues are maybe the most useful since they relate to the type or category of issue being reported

* story
* feature
* idea
* bug
* blocker
* task
* support
* documentation
* content
* theming
* site-building
* performance
* ui-text
* question
* accessibility

**SUB-PROJECT** (cold tints)
Use these labels to tag issues as relating to certain sub-projects of the main project or relating to libraries and imported frameworks

* vizbuilder
* drupal-issue
* drupal-code
* drupal-ui

**STATUS** (black tints)

* resolved
* wontfix
* duplicate
* help wanted
* invalid
* backlog
* confirmed
* deferred
* need-feedback
