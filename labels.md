Project labels
==============

Github issue queue labelling allows issues to be sorted based on a variety of facets. In the past we've developed several different types of label facet groups such as for issue category, status, priority and severity.

Use this list to set up new repo label lists:

**PRIORITY** (full strength)

* critical (red)
* major ()
* normal
* minor

**CATEGORY** (warm pastels)

* bug
* theming
* interface-text
* question
* story
* task
* idea
* feature
* help-request
* documentation
* content

**SUB-PROJECT** (cold tints)

* vizbuilder
* drupal-issue
* drupal-code
* drupal-ui

**STATUS** (black tints)

* resolved
* wontfix
* duplicate
* help wanted
* invalid
* backlog
* confirmed
* deferred
* need-feedback
